# Kubectl Image #

This is just a wrapper docker image for the kubectl application.  

It was installed using the binary with [these instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/).  

Please note that this will not have any context set (or will just have whatever is default) so you are
responsible for setting all of that stuff on your own.
